						TaxWise is one of the best Tax preparation software in the Market.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can work as you like using one of the 2 available versions:
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						The Desktop version, with which you can install your program on your PC from which you plan to liansmit eleclionically,
						and on all PC But remember that only from the PC you chose to liansmit eleclionically is that you can do it.
						But you can install it in your Laptop and use it to visit customers at home and prepare their taxes from there.
					</li>
					<li>
						And you Don't need to have Internet services in the place where you go home, because your program doesn't need it when you're installed on that PC.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						With this version of software you can also work on Network if you are a trainer who has an office in which several are going to work. Trainers at the same time under you.
					</li>
					<li>
						This is done by installing the software on a particular PC and configuring all the other PC you need to use within the Office.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can use it outside the office or at home by remotely accessing your office's PC.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						The only "disadvantage" that the Version Desktop has is that 2 or 3 times during the Tax season, you will have to update the same with the New versions coming in, but you do this in less than a minute.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						With TaxWise you can also: compare the Federal Declarations of your Personal clients and those of all types of Corporations or Business, plus those of the 50 nation states.

					</li>
					<li>
						Convert most of the templates to the Spanish language.
					</li>
					<li>
						Create, edit, delete, print, liansmit your tax returns.
					</li>
					<li>
						All the sheets that you haven't fully completed the program are marked with a red sign.
					</li>
					<li>
						It allows you to make a Diagnostic before liansmitting the statement eleclionically to detect any errors.
					</li>
					<li>
						It allows you to charge your fee for preparation to customers who Don't have the money to pay you at the time of 
						Preparation by deducting your fee from your refund or by making a charge or debit to your bank account if you are not going to Receive a recast through the banking product system.
					</li>
					<li>
						Create different users to handle the program.
					</li>
					<li>
						Convert your customers' Tax Declarations to PDF format to be sent by email.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make the request of the ITIN or Tax ID to customers who need to apply them.
					</li>
					<li>
						Ask for extension of time, if your client is not ready for the last day established by the IRS and the State.
					</li>
					<li>
						Make the customer a payment Plan.
					</li>
					<li>
						Help the customer pay or make a subscription at the time of Tiansmitting the Declaration electronically
					</li>
					<li>
						Transfer all your customers from the previous year, to the new program, to avoid typing them again.
					</li>
					<li>
						Convert the customers of many other software to TaxWise.
					</li>
					<li>
						Manage the order in which you want to print the different tax sheets.
					</li>
					<li>
						Indicating the status of all the taxis you're preparing. If they were accepted, rejected (and why), if you have not yet liansmitted it or it is in process.
					</li>
					<li>
						You can generate, visualize and print multiple types of reports, including Mailing Labels to send letters to your customers.
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						Version Online as your name indicates, you Don't need to install on your PC, you Don't need an exlia Computer or Server to work.
					</li>
					<li>
						In Network because with this version we can work from any computer that has access to the Internet and users can be up to 25
					</li>
					<li>
						Those who can work at the same time. We Don't need to update the program either because it's done automatically on servers.
					</li>
					<li>
						From TaxWise. The only difference is that the Online version does not include corporate modules to be able to prepare business taxes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Stop this, we must install a Desktop Module, work the Coporations taxis there and then liansfer them to the Online System so that they can be Transmitted electronically.
					</li>
					<li>
						This version has additional modules that allow customers to remotely type their W2 and also sign electronically. On their cell phone or tablet.
